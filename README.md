Superstore Management System – Advanced EDA & Power BI Dashboard

This project performs advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Superstore dataset to uncover sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and regional profitability insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, KPI creation, and detailed statistical exploration using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Key business metrics such as revenue growth, profit margin, customer segmentation, and category-wise performance were analyzed to identify high-performing and loss-making segments. Advanced techniques like cohort analysis, time-series trend analysis, and profitability distribution were applied to support data-driven decision-making.

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed with dynamic filters, DAX-based calculations, and data modeling to visualize KPIs, regional performance, sales trends, and product insights for executive-level reporting.

This project demonstrates strong capabilities in data analysis, business intelligence, and dashboard development for real-world business scenarios.
